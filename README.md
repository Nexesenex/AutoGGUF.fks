The most comprehensive GUI tool for GGUF model quantization. Stop wrestling with command lines - quantize, merge, and optimize your models with just a few clicks.

## Features

- üì© Update and manage llama.cpp backends
- üóÉÔ∏è Download and quantize GGUF/safetensors models
- üìê Configure quantization parameters
- üíª Monitor system resources in real time during quantization
- ‚è≥ Parallel quantization + imatrix generation
- üéâ LoRA conversion and merging
- üìÅ Preset saving and loading
- 8Ô∏è‚É£ AutoFP8 quantization
- ü™ì GGUF splitting and merging
- üåê HTTP API for automation and monitoring

## Why AutoGGUF?
- Fast: Saves time on manual configuration
- Simple: Clean UI, no terminal needed
- Powerful: Handles models up to infinite size, only limited by your RAM 
- Resource-aware: Optimized memory management and efficient UI library

## Quick Start

### Cross-platform (recommended)
1. `git clone https://github.com/leafspark/AutoGGUF`
2. `cd AutoGGUF`
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
   or use the `run.bat` script.

macOS and Ubuntu builds are provided with GitHub Actions, you may download the binaries in the releases section.

### Windows (for the impatient)
Standard builds:
1. Download the latest release
2. Extract all files to a folder
3. Run `AutoGGUF-x64.exe`
4. Any necessary folders will be automatically created

Setup builds:
1. Download the setup variant of latest release
2. Extract all files to a folder
3. Run the setup program
4. The .gguf extension will be registered with the program automatically
5. Run the program from the Start Menu or desktop shortcuts

After launching the program, you may access its local server at port 7001 (set `AUTOGGUF_SERVER` to "enabled" first).

### Verifying Releases

#### Linux/macOS:
```bash
gpg --import AutoGGUF-v1.5.0-prerel.asc
gpg --verify AutoGGUF-v1.9.1-Windows-avx2.zip.sig AutoGGUF-v1.9.1-Windows-avx2.zip
sha256sum -c AutoGGUF-v1.9.1.sha256
```

#### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Import the public key
gpg --import AutoGGUF-v1.5.0-prerel.asc

# Verify the signature
gpg --verify AutoGGUF-v1.9.1-Windows-avx2.zip.sig AutoGGUF-v1.9.1-Windows-avx2.zip

# Check SHA256
$fileHash = (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 AutoGGUF-v1.9.1-Windows-avx2.zip).Hash.ToLower()
$storedHash = (Get-Content AutoGGUF-v1.9.1.sha256 | Select-String AutoGGUF-v1.9.1-Windows-avx2.zip).Line.Split()[0]
if ($fileHash -eq $storedHash) { "SHA256 Match" } else { "SHA256 Mismatch" }
```

Release keys are identical to ones used for commiting.

## Building

### Cross-platform
```bash
pip install -U pyinstaller
./build.sh RELEASE | DEV
cd build/<type>/dist/
./AutoGGUF
```

### Windows
```bash
pip install -U pyinstaller
build RELEASE | DEV
```
Find the executable in `build/<type>/dist/AutoGGUF-x64.exe`.

You can also use Nuitka, which may result in a slower build but a faster output executable:
```bash
build_optimized RELEASE | DEV
```

## Localizations

View the list of supported languages at [AutoGGUF/wiki/Installation#configuration](https://github.com/leafspark/AutoGGUF/wiki/Installation#configuration) (LLM translated, except for English).

Languages will be updated as soon as possible after an update, or as a part of the update.

To use a specific language, set the `AUTOGGUF_LANGUAGE` environment variable to one of the listed language codes (note: some languages may not be fully supported yet, in which the UI elements will fall back to English).

## Issues

- Some inconsistent logging and signal handling
- Missing or duplicated translations (priority)
- Buggy/incomplete API interfaces
- Code review and formatting (priority)

## Planned Features

- [ ] Time estimation for quantization
- [ ] Quantization file size estimate
- [ ] Perplexity testing
- [ ] bitsandbytes support

#### Project Status

AutoGGUF has now entered maintenance mode. It's considered stable and feature-complete for most use cases, so I'm not actively developing new features, but I‚Äôll continue to publish occasional builds, update dependencies regularly, and fix critical bugs as needed. If you encounter issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.

## Support

- SSL module cannot be found error: Install OpenSSL or run from source using `python src/main.py` with the `run.bat` script (`pip install requests`)
- Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/leafspark/AutoGGUF/wiki) for advanced usage and configuration
